# **About Me**

Student at Augsburg University earning Bachelor of Science degrees in both Computer Science & Mathematics. Currently working as an IT Data Analyst Intern at 3M in Infrastructure Enterprise Services. At 3M, I specialize in big data analytics including data visualization/dashboard creation, ITSM, and ITSI service modeling. My focus is in computer science with a heavy influence by mathematics. Combining my programming background using primarily Java, Python, and R with my math skills focused in discrete mathematics and statistics, I hope to find a career in the technical industry. Career interests include software engineering, data science, software development, machine learning, and other related fields. Eager to learn, solve, and create.
